                <h3 class="question">What is the difference between Local Storage and Session storage?</h3>
                <p class="answere">SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
                    localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever
                    a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
                    assigned to that particular tab</p>

                <h3 class="question">What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
                <p class="answere">The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block
                    statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not
                    have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.</p>

                <h3 class="question">How does Event loop work in Javascript?</h3>
                <p class="answere">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.
                    If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it
                    to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
